# Calling an external service

This application is a simple demo on how to call an external API in the context of an ASP.NET core application. It makes use of code generation to call the <https://docs.basisregisters.vlaanderen.be/docs/api-documentation.html#tag/api-documentation.html> API.

It also makes use of [Polly](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly) for resilience.
